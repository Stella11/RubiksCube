This is a simple Rule Based Export system AI project done on solving rubik's cube.
This project is NOT GUI.
You need to write the cube information in a particular format (will be provided later) in the main file (com.bunkdeath package)
the format is 

       1 2 3
       4 5 6
       7 8 9

1 2 3  1 2 3  1 2 3  1 2 3                 (top)
4 5 6  4 5 6  4 5 6  4 5 6        (left)   (front)   (right)   (back)
7 8 9  7 8 9  7 8 9  7 8 9                 (bottom)

       1 2 3
       4 5 6
       7 8 9

and in pattern (top)(left)(front)(right)(back)(bottom)

eg if the color combination of the cube is 

       r g o
       w y w
       w w w
b r b  o o o  g g y  g o y
y g w  b o y  b b b  o r r
r r b  o b w  b y g  r y w
       y r r
       g w g
       g o y

then the config will be
config = "rgowywwwwbrbygwrrboooboyobwggybbbbyggoyorrrywyrrgwggoy"

and run the program
